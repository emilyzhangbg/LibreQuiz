## Inspiration
At the University of Waterloo, we noticed that a lot of students were frustrated with having to pay $50+ for a program called iClicker.  The program allows instructors to ask students questions during their lectures and record their answers.  We felt there was no need for students to pay so much for such simple software, and there was no reason that instructors should have to grapple with the difficulties of getting it setup.  We addressed this problem by creating LibreQuiz.

## What it does
LibreQuiz allows users to sign up, and then create and join classes.  Every class has a set of quizzes that the class owner can choose from, each quiz having a set of questions made by the class owner.  The class owner can then start a quiz, and students who have joined that class will be able to see and answer the current active question.  Teachers can then grade the question, and see immediate results to get of sense of where their class is with a topic.

## How we built it
LibreQuiz is built on the web powered by Next.js on the frontend and Firebase on the backend.  We also used the Material UI component library to keep our styles consistent and code organized.

## Challenges we ran into
Many of our group members were not at all familiar with the technologies we planned to use when the project was just getting started.  We spent many hours trying to find ways to get our project not only to work, but to be structured in a maintainable way since we were not familiar with all of the best practices and typical methods ahead of time.  

In addition, the creation of LibreQuiz coincided with a very busy time for all of us on the team with a combination of midterms, projects, and other events going on in our lives.  Thankfully, in the end we were able to find the motivation to work on LibreQuiz in the spare time we did have, and in the end got a viable product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
All of us our very proud of the fact that we were able to build a relatively complete application using technologies had never previously used.  It was a bit of a rocky journey, but we're proud of our ability to work together, learn quickly and execute together to build a project that could be used to solve a real problem.


## What we learned
Aside from learning a ton about general web development, React, Next.js, Material UI and Firebase, through building LibreQuiz, we learned a lot about what its like to program on a team and to take a project from concept to completion.  

## What's next for Libre Quiz
In the future, we would like to give LibreQuiz a bit of a design overhaul to make it stand out more.  We would also like to make easier for students to view their own results, and we want to implement functionality for the student calendar in the app.
